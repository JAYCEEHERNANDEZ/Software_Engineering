                <p>
                    Software project management is an essential part of software engineering. Projects
                    need to be managed because professional software engineering is always subject to
                    organizational budget and schedule constraints. The project manager’s job is to ensure
                    that the software project meets and overcomes these constraints as well as delivering
                    high-quality software. Good management cannot guarantee project success. However,
                    bad management usually results in project failure: the software may be delivered late,
                    cost more than originally estimated, or fail to meet the expectations of customers.
                    The success criteria for project management obviously vary from project to project but, for most projects, important goals are:
                </p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <ul>
                    <p>1. Deliver the software to the customer at the agreed time.</p>
                    <p>2. Keep overall costs within budget.</p>
                    <p>3. Deliver software that meets the customer’s expectations</p>
                    <p>4. Maintain a happy and well-functioning development team</p>
                </ul>
                    <p>These goals are not unique to software engineering but are the goals of all engineering projects. However, software engineering is different from other types of
                    engineering in a number of ways that make software management particularly challenging. Some of these differences are:
                    </p>
                <ul>
                    <p>
                        1. The product is intangible A manager of a shipbuilding or a civil engineering
                        project can see the product being developed. If a schedule slips, the effect on
                        the product is visible—parts of the structure are obviously unfinished.
                        Software is intangible. It cannot be seen or touched. Software project managers
                        cannot see progress by simply looking at the artifact that is being constructed.
                        Rather, they rely on others to produce evidence that they can use to review the
                        progress of the work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. Large software projects are often ‘one-off’ projects Large software projects are
                        usually different in some ways from previous projects. Therefore, even managers who have a large body of previous experience may find it difficult to anticipate problems. Furthermore, rapid technological changes in computers and
                        communications can make a manager’s experience obsolete. Lessons learned
                        from previous projects may not be transferable to new projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. Software processes are variable and organization-specific The engineering
                        process for some types of system, such as bridges and buildings, is well understood. However, software processes vary quite significantly from one organization
                        to another. Although there has been significant progress in process standardization
                        and improvement, we still cannot reliably predict when a particular software
                        process is likely to lead to development problems. This is especially true when the
                        software project is part of a wider systems engineering project.
                    </p>
                </ul>
                    <p>
                    Because of these issues, it is not surprising that some software projects are late,
                    over budget, and behind schedule. Software systems are often new and technically
                    innovative. Engineering projects (such as new transport systems) that are innovative
                    often also have schedule problems. Given the difficulties involved, it is perhaps
                    remarkable that so many software projects are delivered on time and to budget!
                    It is impossible to write a standard job description for a software project manager.
                    The job varies tremendously depending on the organization and the software product
                    being developed. However, most managers take responsibility at some stage for
                    some or all of the following activities:
                    </p>
                <ul>
                    <p>
                        1. Project planning Project managers are responsible for planning, estimating and
                        scheduling project development, and assigning people to tasks. They supervise
                        the work to ensure that it is carried out to the required standards and
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. Reporting Project managers are usually responsible for reporting on the
                        progress of a project to customers and to the managers of the company developing the software. They have to be able to communicate at a range of levels, from
                        detailed technical information to management summaries. They have to write
                        concise, coherent documents that abstract critical information from detailed
                        project reports. They must be able to present this information during progress
                        reviews.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. Risk management Project managers have to assess the risks that may affect a
                        project, monitor these risks, and take action when problems arise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4. People management Project managers are responsible for managing a team of
                        people. They have to choose people for their team and establish ways of working that lead to effective team performance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        5. Proposal writing The first stage in a software project may involve writing a proposal to win a contract to carry out an item of work. The proposal describes the
                        objectives of the project and how it will be carried out. It usually includes cost
                        and schedule estimates and justifies why the project contract should be awarded
                        to a particular organization or team. Proposal writing is a critical task as the survival of many software companies depends on having enough proposals
                        accepted and contracts awarded. There can be no set guidelines for this task;
                        proposal writing is a skill that you acquire through practice and experience.

                <h3>22.1 Risk management</h3>
                <p>Risk management is one of the most important jobs for a project manager. Risk
                management involves anticipating risks that might affect the project schedule or the
                quality of the software being developed, and then taking action to avoid these risks(Hall, 1998; Ould, 1999). You can think of a risk as something that you’d prefer not
                to have happen. Risks may threaten the project, the software that is being developed,
                or the organization. There are, therefore, three related categories of risk:</p>
                <ul>
                    <p>1. Project risks Risks that affect the project schedule or resources. An example of
                        a project risk is the loss of an experienced designer. Finding a replacement
                        designer with appropriate skills and experience may take a long time and, consequently, the software design will take longer to complete</p>
                    <p>2. Product risks Risks that affect the quality or performance of the software being
                        developed. An example of a product risk is the failure of a purchased component
                        to perform as expected. This may affect the overall performance of the system
                        so that it is slower than expected.</p>
                    <p>3. Business risks Risks that affect the organization developing or procuring the
                    software. For example, a competitor introducing a new product is a business
                    risk. The introduction of a competitive product may mean that the assumptions
                    made about sales of existing software products may be unduly optimistic.</p>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Of course, these risk types overlap. If an experienced programmer leaves a
                    project this can be a project risk because, even if they are immediately replaced,
                    the schedule will be affected. It inevitably takes time for a new project member
                    to understand the work that has been done, so they cannot be immediately productive. Consequently, the delivery of the system may be delayed. The loss of a
                    team member can also be a product risk because a replacement may not be as
                    experienced and so could make programming errors. Finally, it can be a business
                    risk because that programmer’s experience may be crucial in winning new
                    contracts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You should record the results of the risk analysis in the project plan along with a
                    consequence analysis, which sets out the consequences of the risk for the project,
                    product, and business. Effective risk management makes it easier to cope with
                    problems and to ensure that these do not lead to unacceptable budget or schedule
                    slippage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The specific risks that may affect a project depend on the project and the organizational environment in which the software is being developed. However, there
                    are also common risks that are not related to the type of software being developed
                    and these can occur in any project. Some of these common risks are shown in
                    Figure 22.1.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Risk management is particularly important for software projects because of the
                    inherent uncertainties that most projects face. These stem from loosely defined
                    requirements, requirements changes due to changes in customer needs, difficulties in
                    estimating the time and resources required for software development, and differences in individual skills. You have to anticipate risks; understand the impact of
                    these risks on the project, the product, and the business; and take steps to avoid these
                    risks. You may need to draw up contingency plans so that, if the risks do occur, you
                    can take immediate recovery action.
                </p>
                <figure><img src="Pictures/Screenshot 1.png" alt="figure"></figure>
                <p>
                    An outline of the process of risk management is illustrated in Figure 22.2. It
                    involves several stages:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <p>1. Risk identification You should identify possible project, product, and business risks</p>
                    <p>2. Risk analysis You should assess the likelihood and consequences of these risks.</p>
                    <p>3. Risk planning You should make plans to address the risk, either by avoiding it or minimizing its effects on the project.</p>
                    <p>4. Risk monitoring You should regularly assess the risk and your plans for risk mitigation and revise these when you learn more about the risk.</p>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You should document the outcomes of the risk management process in a risk
                    management plan. This should include a discussion of the risks faced by the project,
                    an analysis of these risks, and information on how you propose to manage the risk if
                    it seems likely to be a problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The risk management process is an iterative process that continues throughout the
                    project. Once you have drawn up an initial risk management plan, you monitor the
                    situation to detect emerging risks. As more information about the risks becomes available, you have to reanalyze the risks and decide if the risk priority has changed. You
                    may then have to change your plans for risk avoidance and contingency management.

            <article>
                <h3>22.1.1 Risk identification</h3>
                <p>Risk identification is the first stage of the risk management process. It is concerned
                    with identifying the risks that could pose a major threat to the software engineering
                    process, the software being developed, or the development organization. Risk identification may be a team process where a team get together to brainstorm possible
                    risks. Alternatively, the project manager may simply use his or her experience to
                    identify the most probable or critical risks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a starting point for risk identification, a checklist of different types of risk may
                    be used. There are at least six types of risk that may be included in a risk checklist:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <p>1. Technology risks – Risks that derive from the software or hardware technologies that are used to develop the system.</p>
                    <p>2. People risks – Risks that are associated with the people in the development team.</p>
                    <p>3. Organizational risks – Risks that derive from the organizational environment where the software is being developed.</p>
                    <p>4. Tools risks – Risks that derive from the software tools and other support software used to develop the system.</p>
                    <p>5. Requirements risks – Risks that derive from changes to the customer requirements and the process of managing the requirements change.</p>
                    <p>6. Estimation risks – Risks that derive from the management estimates of the resources required to build the system.</p>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Figure 22.3 gives some examples of possible risks in each of these categories.
                    When you have finished the risk identification process, you should have a long list of
                    risks that could occur and which could affect the product, the process, and the business. You then need to prune this list to a manageable size. If you have too many
                    risks, it is practically impossible to keep track of all of them.
                </p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>22.1.2 Risk analysis</h3>
                <p>During the risk analysis process, you have to consider each identified risk and make a judgment about the probability and seriousness of that risk. There is no easy way to do this. You have to rely on your own judgment and experience of previous projects and the problems that arose in them. It is not possible to make precise, numeric assessment of the probability and seriousness of each risk. Rather, you should assign the risk to one of a number of bands:</p>
                  <figure><img src="Pictures/Screenshot 3.png" alt=""></figure>
                <ul>
                    <p>1. The probability of the risk might be assessed as very low ( 10%), low(10–25%), moderate (25–50%), high (50–75%), or very high ( 75%).</p>
                    <p>2. The effects of the risk might be assessed as catastrophic (threaten the survival of the project), serious (would cause major delays), tolerable (delays are within allowed contingency), or insignificant.</p>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You should then tabulate the results of this analysis process using a table ordered
                    according to the seriousness of the risk. Figure 22.4 illustrates this for the risks that I
                    have identified in Figure 22.3. Obviously, the assessment of probability and seriousness is arbitrary here. To make this assessment, you need detailed information about
                    the project, the process, the development team, and the organization. 
                    <br>
                    Of course, both the probability and the assessment of the effects of a risk may
                    change as more information about the risk becomes available and as risk management plans are implemented. Therefore, you should update this table during each
                    iteration of the risk process. 
                    <br>
                    Once the risks have been analyzed and ranked, you should assess which of these
                    risks are most significant. Your judgment must depend on a combination of the
                    probability of the risk arising and the effects of that risk. In general, catastrophic
                    risks should always be considered, as should all serious risks that have more than a moderate probability of occurrence.
                </p>
                <figure><img src="Pictures/Screenshot 4.png" alt=""></figure>
                <p>
                    Boehm (1988) recommends identifying and monitoring the top 10 risks, but I
                    think that this figure is rather arbitrary. The right number of risks to monitor must
                    depend on the project. It might be 5 or it might be 15. However, the number of risks
                    chosen for monitoring should be manageable. A very large number of risks would
                    simply require too much information to be collected. From the risks identified in
                    Figure 22.4, it is appropriate to consider the 8 risks that have catastrophic or serious
                    consequences (Figure 22.5).

                <h3>22.1.3 Risk planning</h3>
                <p>
                    The risk planning process considers each of the key risks that have been identified,
                    and develops strategies to manage these risks. For each of the risks, you have to think
                    of actions that you might take to minimize the disruption to the project if the problem
                    identified in the risk occurs. You also should think about information that you might
                    need to collect while monitoring the project so that problems can be anticipated.Again, there is no simple process that can be followed for contingency planning. It relies on the judgment and experience of the project manager.

                    Figure 22.5 shows possible risk management strategies that have been identified for the key risks (i.e., those that are serious or intolerable) shown in Figure 22.4. These strategies fall into three categories:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <p>1. Avoidance strategies Following these strategies means that the probability that the risk will arise will be reduced. An example of a risk avoidance strategy is the strategy for dealing with defective components shown in Figure 22.5.</p>
                    <p>2. Minimization strategies Following these strategies means that the impact of the risk will be reduced. An example of a risk minimization strategy is the strategy for staff illness shown in Figure 22.5.</p>
                    <p>3. Contingency plans Following these strategies means that you are prepared for the worst and have a strategy in place to deal with it. An example of a contingency strategy is the strategy for organizational financial problems that I have shown in Figure 22.5.</p>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You can see a clear analogy here with the strategies used in critical systems to
                    ensure reliability, security, and safety, where you must avoid, tolerate, or recover from failures. Obviously, it is best to use a strategy that avoids the risk. If this is not
                    possible, you should use a strategy that reduces the chances that the risk will have serious effects. Finally, you should have strategies in place to cope with the risk if it arises. These should reduce the overall impact of a risk on the project or product.

                <h3>22.1.4 Risk monitoring</h3>
                <p>
                    Risk monitoring is the process of checking that your assumptions about the product,
                    process, and business risks have not changed. You should regularly assess each of
                    the identified risks to decide whether or not that risk is becoming more or less probable. You should also think about whether or not the effects of the risk have changed.
                    To do this, you have to look at other factors, such as the number of requirements
                    change requests, which give you clues about the risk probability and its effects.
                    These factors are obviously dependent on the types of risk. Figure 22.6 gives some
                    examples of factors that may be helpful in assessing these risk types.
                    You should monitor risks regularly at all stages in a project. At every management
                    review, you should consider and discuss each of the key risks separately. You should
                    decide if the risk is more or less likely to arise and if the seriousness and consequences of the risk have changed.

                <h2>22.2 Managing people</h2>
                <p>
                    The people working in a software organization are its greatest assets. It costs a lot to
                    recruit and retain good people and it is up to software managers to ensure that the
                    organization gets the best possible return on its investment. In successful companies
                    and economies, this is achieved when people are respected by the organization and are assigned responsibilities that reflect their skills and experience
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is important that software project managers understand the technical issues
                    that influence the work of software development. Unfortunately, however, good
                    software engineers are not necessarily good people managers. Software engineers
                    often have strong technical skills but may lack the softer skills that enable them toIt is important that software project managers understand the technical issues

                    software engineers are not necessarily good people managers. Software engineers
                    often have strong technical skills but may lack the softer skills that enable them to
                </p>
                <p>In my view, there are four critical factors in people management:</p>
                <ul>
                    <p>1. Consistency – People in a project team should all be treated in a comparable way. No one expects all rewards to be identical but people should not feel that their contribution to the organization is undervalued.</p>
                    <p>2. Respect – Different people have different skills and managers should respect these differences. All members of the team should be given an opportunity to make a contribution. In some cases, of course, you will find that people simply don’t fit into a team and they cannot continue, but it is important not to jump to conclusions about this at an early stage in the project.</p>
                    <p>3. Inclusion – People contribute effectively when they feel that others listen to them and take account of their proposals. It is important to develop a working environment where all views, even those of the most junior staff, are considered.</p>
                    <p>4. Honesty – As a manager, you should always be honest about what is going well and what is going badly in the team. You should also be honest about your level of technical knowledge and willing to defer to staff with more knowledge when necessary. If you try to cover up ignorance or problems you will eventually be found out and will lose the respect of the group.</p>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    People management, in my view, is something that has to be based on experience,
                    rather than learned from a book. My aim in this section and the following section on
                    teamwork is simply to introduce some of the most important people and team management problems that affect software project management. I hope the material here will
                    sensitize you to some of the problems that managers may encounter when dealing with teams of technically talented individuals.

            <article>
                <p>
                As a project manager, you need to motivate the people that work with you so that
                they contribute to the best of their abilities. Motivation means organizing the work
                and the working environment to encourage people to work as effectively as possible.
                If people are not motivated, they will not be interested in the work they are doing.
                They will work slowly, be more likely to make mistakes, and will not contribute to
                the broader goals of the team or the organization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To provide this encouragement, you should understand a little about what motivates people. Maslow (1954) suggests that people are motivated by satisfying their
                    needs. These needs are arranged in a series of levels, as shown in Figure 22.7. The
                    lower levels of this hierarchy represent fundamental needs for food, sleep, and so on,
                    and the need to feel secure in an environment. Social needs are concerned with the
                    need to feel part of a social grouping. Esteem needs represent the need to feel respected by others, and self-realization needs are concerned with personal development. People need to satisfy lower-level needs like hunger before the more abstract,
                    higher-level needs.
                </p>
                 <figure><img src="Pictures/Screenshot 7.png" alt=""></figure>
                 <p>
                    People working in software development organizations are not usually hungry or
                    thirsty or physically threatened by their environment. Therefore, making sure that
                    people’s social, esteem, and self-realization needs are satisfied is most important
                    from a management point of view.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <p>1. To satisfy social needs, you need to give people time to meet their co-workers and provide places for them to meet. This is relatively easy when all of the members of a development team work in the same place but, increasingly, team members are not located in the same building or even the same town or state. They may work for different organizations or from home most of the time.
                         Social networking systems and teleconferencing can be used to facilitate communications but my experience with electronic systems is that they are most effective once people know each other. You therefore need to arrange some face-to-face meetings early in the project so that people can directly interact with other members of the team. Through this direct interaction, people become part of a social group and accept the goals and priorities of that group.</p>
                    <p>2. To satisfy esteem needs, you need to show people that they are valued by the organization. Public recognition of achievements is a simple yet effective way of doing this. Obviously, people must also feel that they are paid at a level that reflects their skills and experience.</p>
                    <p>3. Finally, to satisfy self-realization needs, you need to give people responsibility for their work, assign them demanding (but not impossible) tasks, and provide a training programme where people can develop their skills. Training is an important motivating influence as people like to gain new knowledge and learn new skills.</p>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In Figure 22.8, I illustrate a problem of motivation that managers often have to
                    face. In this example, a competent group member loses interest in the work and in the group as a whole. The quality of her work falls and becomes unacceptable. This
                    situation has to be dealt with quickly. If you don’t sort out the problem, the other
                    group members will become dissatisfied and feel that they are doing an unfair share
                    of the work.
                </p>
                 <figure><img src="Pictures/Screenshot 8.png" alt=""></figure>
                 <p>
                    In this example, Alice tries to find out if Dorothy’s personal circumstances could
                    be the problem. Personal difficulties commonly affect motivation because people
                    cannot concentrate on their work. You may have to give them time and support to
                    resolve these issues, although you also have to make it clear that they still have a
                    responsibility to their employer.
                    Dorothy’s motivation problem is one that is quite common when projects develop
                    in an unexpected direction. People who expect to do one type of work may end up
                    doing something completely different. This becomes a problem when team members
                    want to develop their skills in a way that is different from that taken by the project.
                    In those circumstances, you may decide that the team member should leave the team
                    and find opportunities elsewhere. In this example, however, Alice decides to try to
                    convince Dorothy that broadening her experience is a positive career step. She gives
                    Dorothy more design autonomy and organizes training courses in software engineering that will give her more opportunities after her current project has finished.
                 </p>
                  <figure><img src="Pictures/Screenshot 9.png" alt=""></figure>
                  <p>
                    Maslow’s model of motivation is helpful up to a point but I think that a problem
                    with it is that it takes an exclusively personal viewpoint on motivation. It does not
                    take adequate account of the fact that people feel themselves to be part of an organization, a professional group, and one or more cultures. This is not simply a question
                    of satisfying social needs—people can be motivated through helping a group achieve
                    shared goals.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    Being a member of a cohesive group is highly motivating for most people. People
                    with fulfilling jobs often like to go to work because they are motivated by the people
                    they work with and the work that they do. Therefore, as well as thinking about individual motivation you also have to think about how a group as a whole can be motivated to achieve the organization’s goals. I discuss group management issues in the
                    next section.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    Personality type also influences motivation. Bass and Dunteman (1963) classify
                    professionals into three types:
                 </p>
                 <ul>
                    <p>1. Task-oriented people, who are motivated by the work they do. In software engineering, these are people who are motivated by the intellectual challenge of software development.</p>
                    <p>2. Self-oriented people, who are principally motivated by personal success and recognition. They are interested in software development as a means of achieving their own goals. 
                        This does not mean that these people are selfish and think only of their own concerns. Rather, they often have longer-term goals, such as career progression, that motivate them and they wish to be successful in their work to help realize these goals.</p>
                    <p>3. Interaction-oriented people, who are motivated by the presence and actions of co-workers. As software development becomes more user-centered, interaction-oriented individuals are becoming more involved in software engineering.</p>
                 </ul>
                 <p>
                    Interaction-oriented personalities usually like to work as part of a group, whereas
                    task-oriented and self-oriented people usually prefer to act as individuals. Women
                    are more likely to be interaction-oriented than men. They are often more effective
                    communicators. I discuss the mix of these different personality types in groups in the
                    case study in Figure 22.10.Each individual’s motivation is made up of elements of each class but one type
                    of motivation is usually dominant at any one time. However, individuals can
                    change. For example, technical people who feel they are not being properly
                    rewarded can become self-oriented and put personal interests before technical concerns. If a group works particularly well, self-oriented people can become more
                    interaction-oriented.

                <h2>22.3 Teamwork</h2>
                <p>
                    Most professional software is developed by project teams that range in size from two
                    to several hundred people. However, as it is clearly impossible for everyone in a
                    large group to work together on a single problem, large teams are usually split into
                    a number of groups. Each group is responsible for developing part of the overall
                    system. As a general rule, software engineering project groups should not have more
                    than 10 members. When small groups are used, communication problems are
                    reduced. Everyone knows everyone else and the whole group can get around a table
                    for a meeting to discuss the project and the software that they are developing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Putting together a group that has the right balance of technical skills, experience,
                    and personalities is a critical management task. However, successful groups are
                    more than simply a collection of individuals with the right balance of skills. A good
                    group is cohesive and has a team spirit. The people involved are motivated by the
                    success of the group as well as by their own personal goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a cohesive group, members think of the group as more important than the individuals who are group members. Members of a well-led, cohesive group are loyal to
                    the group. They identify with group goals and other group members. They attempt to
                    protect the group, as an entity, from outside interference. This makes the group
                    robust and able to cope with problems and unexpected situations.
                    The benefits of creating a cohesive group are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                   <p>1. The group can establish its own quality standards – Because these standards are established by consensus, they are more likely to be observed than external standards imposed on the group.</p>
                    <p>2. Individuals learn from and support each other – People in the group learn from each other. Inhibitions caused by ignorance are minimized as mutual learning is encouraged.</p>
                    <p>3. Knowledge is shared – Continuity can be maintained if a group member leaves. Others in the group can take over critical tasks and ensure that the project is not unduly disrupted.</p>
                    <p>4. Refactoring and continual improvement is encouraged – Group members work collectively to deliver high-quality results and fix problems, irrespective of the individuals who originally created the design or program.</p>
                </ul>
                <figure><img src="Pictures/Screenshot 10.png" alt=""></figure>
                <p>
                    Good project managers should always try to encourage group cohesiveness. They
                    may organize social events for group members and their families, try to establish a
                    sense of group identity by naming the group and establishing a group identity and
                    territory, or they may get involved in explicit group-building activities such as sports
                    and games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the most effective ways of promoting cohesion is to be inclusive. This
                    means that you should treat group members as responsible and trustworthy, and
                    make information freely available. Sometimes, managers feel that they cannot reveal
                    certain information to everyone in the group. This invariably creates a climate of
                    mistrust. Simple information exchange is an effective way of making people feel valued and that they are part of a group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can see an example of this in the case study in Figure 22.9. Alice arranges
                    regular informal meetings where she tells the other group members what is going on.
                    She makes a point of involving people in the product development by asking them to
                    come up with new ideas derived from their own family experiences. The ‘away days’
                    are also good ways of promoting cohesion—people relax together while they help
                    each other learn about new technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether or not a group is effective depends, to some extent, on the nature of the
                    project and the organization doing the work. If an organization is in a state of turmoil
                    with constant reorganizations and job insecurity, it is very difficult for team members
                    to focus on software development. However, apart from project and organizational
                    issues, there are three generic factors that affect team working:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <p>1. The people in the group – You need a mix of people in a project group as software development involves diverse activities such as negotiating with clients, programming, testing, and documentation.</p>
                    <p>2. The group organization – A group should be organized so that individuals can contribute to the best of their abilities and tasks can be completed as expected.</p>
                    <p>3. Technical and managerial communications – Good communications between group members, and between the software engineering team and other project stakeholders, is essential.</p>
                </ul>
                <p>
                   As with all management issues, getting the right team cannot guarantee project
                    success. Too many other things can go wrong, including changes to the business and
                    the business environment. However, if you don’t pay attention to group composition,
                    organization, and communications, you increase the likelihood that your project will
                    run into difficulties

                <h3>22.3.1 Selecting group members</h3>
                <p>
                    A manager or team leader’s job is to create a cohesive group and organize their
                    group so that they can work together effectively. This involves creating a group with
                    the right balance of technical skills and personalities, and organizing that group so
                    that the members work together effectively. Sometimes, people are hired from outside the organization; more often, however, software engineering groups are put
                    together from current employees who have experience on other projects. However,
                    managers rarely have a completely free hand in team selection. They often have to
                    use the people who are available in the company, even when they may not be the
                    ideal people for the job
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I discussed in Section 22.2.1, many software engineers are motivated primarily by their work. Software development groups, therefore, are often composed of
                    people who have their own ideas about how technical problems should be solved.
                    This is reflected in regularly reported problems of interface standards being ignored,
                    systems being redesigned as they are coded, unnecessary system embellishments,
                    and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A group that has complementary personalities may work better than a group that
                    is selected solely on technical ability. People who are motivated by the work are
                    likely to be the strongest technically. People who are self-oriented will probably be
                    best at pushing the work forward to finish the job. People who are interactionoriented help facilitate communications within the group. I think that it is particularly important to have interaction-oriented people in a group. They like to talk to
                    people and can detect tensions and disagreements at an early stage, before these have
                    a serious impact on the group
                </p>
                <p>
                    he case study in Figure 22.10, I have suggested how Alice, the project manager, has tried to create a group with complementary personalities. This particular
                    group has a good mix of interaction- and task-oriented people but I have already discussed, in Figure 22.8, how Dorothy’s self-oriented personality has caused problems
                    because she has not been doing the work that she expected. Fred’s part-time role in
                    the group as a domain expert might also be a problem. He is mostly interested in technical challenges, so he may not interact well with other group members. The
                    fact that he is not always part of the team means that he may not relate well to the
                    team’s goals
                </p>
                <figure><img src="Pictures/Screenshot 11.png" alt=""></figure>
                <p>
                    It is sometimes impossible to choose a group with complementary personalities.
                    If this is the case, the project manager has to control the group so that individual
                    goals do not take precedence over organizational and group objectives. This control
                    is easier to achieve if all group members participate in each stage of the project.
                    Individual initiative is most likely when group members are given instructions without being aware of the part that their task plays in the overall project.</p>
                <p>
                    For example, say a software engineer is given a program design for coding and
                    notices what appears to be possible improvements that could be made to the design.
                    If he or she implements these improvements without understanding the rationale for
                    the original design, any changes, though well intentioned, might have adverse implications for other parts of the system. If all the members of the group are involved in
                    the design from the start, they will understand why design decisions have been made.
                    They may then identify with these decisions rather than oppose them.

                <h3>22.3.2 Group organization</h3>
                <p>
                    The way that a group is organized affects the decisions that are made by that group,
                    the ways that information is exchanged, and the interactions between the development group and external project stakeholders. Important organizational questions for project managers include:
                </p>
                <figure><img src="Pictures/Screenshot 12.png" alt=""></figure>
                <ul>
                    <p>1. Should the project manager be the technical leader of the group? The technical leader or system architect is responsible for the critical technical decisions made during software development. Sometimes, the project manager has the skill 
                        and experience to take on this role. However, for large projects, it is best to appoint a senior engineer to be the project architect, who will take responsibility for technical leadership.</p>
                    <p>2. Who will be involved in making critical technical decisions, and how will these be made? Will decisions be made by the system architect, the project manager, or by reaching consensus amongst a wider range of team members?</p>
                    <p>3. How will interactions with external stakeholders and senior company management be handled? In many cases, the project manager will be responsible for these interactions, assisted by the system architect if there is one.
                        However, an alternative organizational model is to create a dedicated role concerned with external liaison, and appoint someone with appropriate interaction skills to that role.</p>
                    <p>4. How can groups integrate people who are not colocated? It is now common for groups to include members from different organizations and people to work from home as well as in a shared office. This has to be taken into account in group decision-making processes.</p>
                    <p>5. How can knowledge be shared across the group? Group organization affects information sharing as certain methods of organization are better for sharing than others. However, you should avoid too much information sharing as people become overloaded and excessive information distracts them from their work.</p>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Small programming groups are usually organized in a fairly informal way. The
                    group leader gets involved in the software development with the other group members. In an informal group, the work to be carried out is discussed by the group as a
                    whole, and tasks are allocated according to ability and experience. More senior
                    group members may be responsible for the architectural design. However, detailed
                    design and implementation is the responsibility of the team member who is allocated
                    to a particular task.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Extreme programming groups (Beck, 2000) are always informal groups. XP
                    enthusiasts claim that formal structure inhibits information exchange. In XP, many decisions that are usually seen as management decisions (such as decisions on
                    schedule) are devolved to group members. Programmers work together in pairs to
                    develop code and take joint responsibility for the programs that are developed.
                    Informal groups can be very successful, particularly when most group members
                    are experienced and competent. Such a group makes decisions by consensus, which
                    improves cohesiveness and performance. However, if a group is composed mostly of
                    inexperienced or incompetent members, informality can be a hindrance because no
                    definite authority exists to direct the work, causing a lack of coordination between
                    group members and, possibly, eventual project failure.
                    Hierarchical groups are groups that have a hierarchical structure with the group
                    leader at the top of the hierarchy. He or she has more formal authority than the group
                    members and so can direct their work. There is a clear organizational structure and
                    decisions are made towards the top of the hierarchy and implemented by people
                    lower down the hierarchy. Communications are primarily instructions from senior
                    staff and there is relatively little ‘upward’ communication from the lower levels to
                    the upper levels in the hierarchy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This approach can work well when a well-understood problem can be easily
                    broken into subproblems with subproblem solutions developed in different parts of
                    the hierarchy. In those situations, relatively little communication across the hierarchy is required. However, suc
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <p>1. Changes to the software often require changes to several parts of the system and this requires discussion and negotiation at all levels in the hierarchy.</p>
                    <p>2. Software technologies change so fast that more junior staff often know more about the technology than experienced staff. Top-down communications may mean that the project manager does not find out about the opportunities of using new technologies. More junior staff may become frustrated because of what they see as old-fashioned technologies being used for development.</p>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Democratic and hierarchic group organizations do not formally recognize that
                    there may be very large differences in technical ability between group members. The
                    best programmers may be up to 25 times more productive as the worst programmers.
                    It makes sense to use the best people in the most effective way and to provide them
                    with as much support as possible. An early organizational model that was intended
                    to provide this support was the chief programmer team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To make the most effective use of highly skilled programmers, Baker (1972)
                    and others (Aron, 1974; Brooks, 1975) suggested that teams should be built
                    around an individual, highly skilled chief programmer. The underlying principle of
                    the chief programmer team is that skilled and experienced staff should be responsible for all software development. They should not be concerned with routine
                    matters and should have good technical and administrative support for their work.
                    They should focus on the software to be developed and not spend a lot of time in
                    external meetings.
                </p>
                <figure><img src="Pictures/Screenshot 13.png" alt=""></figure>
                <p>
                    However, the chief programmer team organization is, in my view, overdependent
                    on the chief programmer and their assistant. Other team members who are not given
                    sufficient responsibility may become demotivated because they feel their skills are
                    underused. They do not have the information to cope if things go wrong and are not
                    given the opportunity to participate in decision making. There are significant project
                    risks associated with this group organization and these may outweigh any benefits
                    that this kind of organization might bring.

                <h3>22.3.3 Group communications</h3>
                <p>
                    It is absolutely essential that group members communicate effectively and efficiently
                    with each other and with other project stakeholders. Group members must exchange
                    information on the status of their work, the design decisions that have been made, and
                    changes to previous design decisions. They have to resolve problems that arise with
                    other stakeholders and inform these stakeholders of changes to the system, the group,
                    and delivery plans. Good communication also helps strengthen group cohesiveness.
                    Group members come to understand the motivations, strengths, and weaknesses of
                    other people in the group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The effectiveness and efficiency of communications is influenced by:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <p>1. Group size – As a group gets bigger, it gets harder for members to communicate effectively. The number of one-way communication links is n * (n - 1), where n is the group size, so, with a group of eight members, there are 56 possible communication pathways. This means that it is quite possible that some people will rarely communicate with each other. Status differences between group members mean 
                        that communications are often one-way. Managers and experienced engineers tend to dominate communications with less experienced staff, who may be reluctant to start a conversation or make critical remarks.</p>
                    <p>2. Group structure – People in informally structured groups communicate more effectively than people in groups with a formal, hierarchical structure. In hierarchical groups, communications tend to flow up and down the hierarchy. People at the same level may not talk to each other. This is a particular problem in a large project with several development groups. If people working on different subsystems only communicate through their managers, then there are more likely to be delays and misunderstandings.</p>
                    <p>3. Group composition – People with the same personality types (discussed in Section 22.2) may clash and, as a result, communications can be inhibited. Communication is also usually better in mixed-sex groups (Marshall and Heslin, 1975) than in single-sex groups. Women are often more interaction-oriented than men and may act as interaction controllers and facilitators for the group.</p>
                    <p>4. The physical work environment – The organization of the workplace is a major factor in facilitating or inhibiting communications. See the book’s webpage for more information.</p>
                    <p>5. The available communication channels – There are many different forms of communication—face-to-face, e-mail messages, formal documents, telephone, and Web 2.0 technologies such as social networking and wikis. As project teams become increasingly distributed, with team members working remotely, you need to make use of a range of technologies to facilitate communications.</p>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Project managers usually work to tight deadlines and, consequently, they may try to
                    use communication channels that don’t take up too much of their time. They may
                    therefore rely on meetings and formal documents to pass on information to project
                    staff and stakeholders. Although this may be an efficient approach to communication
                    from a project manager’s perspective, it is not usually very effective. There are often
                    good reasons why people can’t attend meetings and so they don’t hear the presentation.
                    Long documents are often never read because readers don’t know if the documents are
                    relevant. When several versions of the same document are produced, readers find it
                    difficult to keep track of the changes
                </p>
                <p>
                    Effective communication is achieved when communications are two way, and the
                    people involved can discuss issues and information and establish a common understanding of proposals and problems. This can be done through meetings, although
                    these are often dominated by powerful personalities. It is sometimes impractical to
                    arrange meetings at short notice. More and more project teams include remote members, which also makes meetings more difficult.
                </p>
                <p>
                   To counter these problems, you may make use of web technologies such as wikis
                    and blogs to support information exchange. Wikis support the collaborative
                    creation and editing of documents, and blogs support threaded discussions about
                    questions and comments made by group members. Wikis and blogs allow project
                    members and external stakeholders to exchange information, irrespective of their
                    location. They help manage information and keep track of discussion threads,
                    which often become confusing when conducted by e-mail. You can also use instant
                    messaging and teleconferences, which can be easily arranged, to resolve issues that
                    need discussion.
